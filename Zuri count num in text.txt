3.1          PREAMBLE OF METHODOLOGY
This research is based mainly on the use of Remote sensing data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques. It goes by identifying the research problems, acquiring the necessary data from available sources and carrying out classification to determine trend of changes in Naworie river, from 2003 to 2018. After the identification of the variable research problem, the data required and the available sources of the data were also identified. The scope, potential limitation and nature of the study have also been considered. This chapter discuses the method/ procedures that would be used in data analysis and result presentation.

3.2     RECONNAISSANCE
Every survey project to be undertaken should start with reconnaissance. Recce survey help to collect initial information regarding the presence or absence or absence of historic properties within a project area (www.palmettohistory.org).
Reconnaissance survey was carried on the project site (Nwaorie River) to collect coordinates of of the section of the river for this study and to ascertain the physical condition of the river.
A list of six coordinates of point delineating the a section of the river is given in table 3.1(a).
